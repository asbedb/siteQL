siteQL is my first major undertaking to build a full-stack web application. This stack is built to be a modular SQL database/website installer with credentials created and hashed for first user login. The installer goes through a guided form and finalises with a database configuration and www root directory.

## Key Features
siteQL is built to make deploying webapp's admin friendly and can be implemented in a number of projects with minimal dependencies.

## Dependencies
siteQL assumes the following dependencies:

- Node.js (for running NPM commands)
- LAMP/XAMP Stack (for SQL and web server)

## Installation
To install siteQL locally, clone the repository and run the following command in the project directory:

```npm install```

The root should be in a hosted environment locally to serve pages via your browser.
