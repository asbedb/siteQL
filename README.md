siteQL is my first major undertaking to build a full-stack web application using NextJS, TypeScript and various libraries associated. 

The application is built to be a modular SQL database/website aplication installer with credentials created and hashed for first user login. 

The installer goes through a guided form and finalises with a database configuration and reroute.

## Key Features
- Theme customisation
- Extensive API library that can be used post installation
- Function centralisation
- Reactive UI elements based on installation step including an inbuilt notification/toast system. 

## Dependencies
siteQL assumes the following dependencies:

- Node.js (for running NPM commands)
- Existing SQL Service (Preferably MariaDB)

## Installation
To install siteQL locally, clone the repository and run the following command in the project directory:

```npm install```

as the project runs on NextJS/React to run a local development environment you can follow up the command with

```npm run dev```
